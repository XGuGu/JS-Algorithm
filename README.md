# Percolation

Problem description: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html

I would like to make a visualized demo for the Percolation Problem. The algorithm used will be the weighted quick union.

## MVP List:
1. Modal: a n-by-n grid of sites, each grid can be either opened or blocked.
2. Visualization of simulation
3. Problem analysis


If there is more time, I would like to add more algorithm demo to this project. Like: sorting algorithms.
